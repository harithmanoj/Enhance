Develop Release v1.3.2.8.d1 alpha


Enhance C++ Libraries is a collection of multiple `C++` libraries that cater 
to many needs.

Including but not limited to :

* Diagnostics.
* Time and related tracking and synchronisation.
* Date Time manipulation
* Error Tracking.qu
* Version info to be used inside programs.
* Concurrent execution.

The Library requires `C++ standard 17` to compile.

The Library is released under [Apache License](https://github.com/harithmanoj/Enhance/blob/master/License.md)

Source code is Hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/harithmanoj/Enhance)

Stable Releases can be found [here](https://github.com/harithmanoj/Enhance/releases)

Code Documentation is Hosted by GitHub Pages [here](https://harithmanoj.github.io/Enhance-cpp-libraries/nav/doc.html)

The branch master of Enhance repository contains last stable release code. For latest features, 
bugfixes etc, see develop branch.

Documentation of pre-release bug fixes and features can also be found [here](https://harithmanoj.github.io/Enhance-cpp-libraries/nav/doc.html)

<details>
<summary> Concurrent </summary>

Library for ease of concurrent programming.

Exists in `namespace enh`.

### Headers 

`QueuedProcess.enh.h`

### The Library 

* Class to asynchronously handle messages.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Diagnose </summary>

Diagnose is a diagnostics library to log to file during sequential code 
execution.

Exists in `namespace debug`, but use Macros for logging easily.

See `logger.enh.h` documentation for usage.

### Headers 

`logger.enh.h`

### The Library 

* Functions that log information to a file unique to each thread
* (E)rror, (W)arning, (I)nfo, (F)atal-(E)rror types of logging.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Error Handling </summary>

Error Handling Library is a library that contains functions and classes for 
various error handling uses.

Error tracking functionality and error signaling functionality.

Exists in `namespace enh`.

### Headers 

`ErrorTracker.enh.h`

`Tristate.enh.h`

### The Library 

* Class to be used for base class for inheriting error management functionality.

* Enumeration to provide 3 possible outcomes (good, error, blocked due to 
previous error) for functions.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Time </summary>

Library for date-time encapsulation, periodic signaling timer.

Exists in `namespace enh`.

### Header

`timer.enh.h`

`counter.enh.h`

`TimeStamp.enh.h`

`date.enh.h`

`DateTime.enh.h`

### The Library 

* Tracking time in a sec : min : hr : day manner(representation).

* Tracking time elapsed and providing clients to the class periodical signals.

* Block execution of a thread for a period of time accurately.

* Store and manipulate time.

* Store and manipulate date.

* Store and manipulate date and time simultaneously.

<details>
<summary> General Utility</summary>

The library consists of some utility functions, classes, class for versioning 
encapsulation, class for a value confined within dynamic and static limits, 
value which spans different fields of different denominations.

Exists in `namespace enh`.

### Headers 

`general.enh.h`

`ConfinedValue.enh.h`

`LimitedNumber.enh.h`

`WeightedField.enh.h`

`VersionInfo.enh.h`

### The Library 

* Class to be used for storing version information.
* Version of the Enhance C++ library
* Check if bits are high in a variable (also constexpr).
* Check if value is within bounds (also constexpr).
* Signum function and inclusive_ration (also constexpr).
* getOrdinalIndicator returns "th", "st", "nd" "rd" according to argument passed.
* signExtend extends the string format of a numeral by prepending '0' s
* ConfinedValue class for storing a value within bounds
* NumericSystem class for storing a value within 0 and an upper limit.
* Class to hold values which has different denominations. (eg money)
